# AWS ML Engineer Capstone Project

Welcome to my capstone project for the Udacity AWS Machine Learning Course <https://www.udacity.com/enrollment/nd189>.

## Project Overview
For this project we're going to explore ways of computing confidence for regression model predictions. In particular we'd like to deploy 'sets of models' into AWS, ensembles for bootstrapping and quantile regression. Our model scripts and AWS endpoints will use groups of models and provide additional information like prediction intervals and quantile ranges. We're also going to compare/contrast these against a KNN model for regression confidence metrics.

## Datasets and Inputs
For this project, we're going to use the publicly available AqSol Database [1]. This is a curated reference set of aqueous solubility, created by the Autonomous Energy Materials Discovery [AMD] research group, consists of aqueous solubility values of 9,982 unique compounds curated from 9 different publicly available aqueous solubility datasets. AqSolDB also contains some relevant topological and physico-chemical 2D descriptors. Additionally, AqSolDB contains validated molecular representations of each of the compounds.

## Problem Statement
Within the domain of **drug discovery**, data used for model training often comes from bench experiments where a property like solubility is measured. As part of the data collection, there is often **noise** associated with the measurement, differences in temperature, pH, and extraction procedures can lead to variability. Also compounds can hit activity cliffs (see [2][3][4]) where a small molecular change can lead to a significant difference in the response variable. For all of these scenarios, we'd like to provide a set of models that together will provide both a regression prediction and confidence score for each observation.

## Metrics
We'd like our confidence metric to capture areas in feature space where the model is more or less confident in it's predictions. In areas of high confidence we'd expect to have smaller errors and in areas of low confidence we'd expect to see larger errors. We'll use statistics and boxplots that capture the prediction errors.

The metrics will include standard descriptive statistics about each of the confidence 'bands' (low, medium, and high). 

- min/max
- mean
- stddev
- Q1, Q2, Q3, IQR

The delination of the confidence bands (low, medium, and high) will be as follows:

- **Low** (0.0 to 0.33)
- **Medium** (0.33 to 0.66)
- **High** (0.66 to 1.0)

The calculation of the confidence score will be domain specific, meaning that for our particular dataset and target values will look at the ensemble model outputs and determine a heuristic for a confidence score that ranges from 0.0 to 1.0.

## Exploratory Visualization
Our main goal here is to use AWS **ensemble** models to help us identify areas of feature space where the model has high or low confidence in its predictions. To help us visualize the feature space we'll use the UMAP[5] projection algorithm to project the 17 dimenional feature space down to 2.

</figure>

In the image above we can see that some areas have a relatively low target variance and standard regression models (like XGBRegressor) should be able to make relatively accurate predictions in those areas. We also some some areas with higher variance that may indicate compounds on activity cliffs, noisy experimental measurements, or simply mislabeled solubility metrics.


## Algorithms and Techniques

1. **Prediction Intervals using Bootstrapping**
   - Bootstrapping involves repeatedly sampling from the training data and fitting the model multiple times to generate a distribution of predictions. This can be used to estimate prediction intervals. This approach should be robust and doesn't make assumptions about a particular distribution. 
  
1. **Quantile Regression**
   - A set of models with different objective functions that can provide quantile estimates for predictions. Combines the benefits of quantile regression and ensemble methods. We'll estimate a range of quantiles that should give us a 'spread' of target values within that region of feature space.

1. **Quantile Regression + Residuals Model**: This model will provide predictions at different quantiles, offering a broader sense of the distribution within the training data. It will help in understanding the range and variability of predictions. Included as part of this functionality is the computation of residuals for all of the observations (using 5-Fold Cross validation and aggregating the results).
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model**: This model will use the distances to the nearest neighbors in the feature space. Observations that have close neighbors with low variance in their target values will have higher neighborhood 'quality' levels, while those in high variance neighborhoods or sparse regions will have lower quality levels.

These models and endpoints will be implemented using AWS SageMaker, leveraging its robust infrastructure for training, deploying, and scaling machine learning models.



## Benchmark Model

For the benchmark model, we'll use the AWS Linear Learner model. This model will provide point predictions without any data quality or confidence estimates, serving as a baseline to compare the performance against the evaluation metrics defined below.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of both the benchmark model and the proposed data quality models will be evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: To measure the accuracy of the point predictions. We'll measure the benchmark model with ALL the data (80/20 split), and then we'll partition the data into 3 segments: high, medium, and low quality. The MAE on 80/20 splits will be provided for the 4 categories: all, high, med, and low.
- **ROC Curves/AUC**: Similar to the MAE, we provide a ROC curve plot (with AUC scores) for each of the 4 categories (all, high, med, low). Since ROC curves are traditionally used with classification data, we'll employ an 'Accurate' column that looks at the residuals and if they are less than some delta then we'll consider the prediction as an accurate prediction. **Example:** For LogS solubility we might define any prediction within 0.5 log units as being an accurate prediction. This will be a parameter that can be adjusted for different use cases.

## Project Design

The project will develop and implement data quality/confidence models within the AWS SageMaker environment.

1. **AQSol Public Data**: We'll use the Aqueous Solubility public dataset to provide an example of realistic data that contains inherent noise in the target variable (Solubility).

1. **Model Training**: Will use the AWS SageMaker model training functionality to train our two data quality models.
   - **Quantile Regression + Residuals**: Model to predict different quantiles of the target variable. This model will also compute residuals as described above.
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model**: Develop a KNN-based model to estimate confidence levels based on the density and variability of observations in the feature space.

1. **Endpoint Deployment**: Deploy the models on AWS SageMaker, setting up endpoints for real-time predictions and confidence estimates.
1. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using the defined metrics, comparing them against the benchmark model.
1. **Visualization and Reporting**: Create visualizations to illustrate the distribution of predictions and confidence levels, and compile a comprehensive report documenting the findings and insights from the project.

By following this workflow, the project aims to deliver robust data quality/confidence models that enhance the interpretability and reliability of machine learning predictions in AWS.
